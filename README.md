# MEDICAL_ASSISTENCE_ALERT_SYSTEM
The goal is to build an automated medical alert system using facial expression analysis. We explored different techniques like feature extraction and neural networks. The system monitors facial expressions using machine learning to distinguish between normal and distress signals. It's trained on a diverse dataset. When it detects a problem, it alerts family members promptly.
