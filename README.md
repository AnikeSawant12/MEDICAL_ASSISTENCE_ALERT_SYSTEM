# MEDICAL_ASSISTENCE_ALERT_SYSTEM
The project aimed to develop a website that determines a person's health based on the image input provided by them. This website includes a user-facing UI built using HTML, CSS, and Flask, where users upload an image. In the backend, we utilize a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) deep learning algorithm built using Python to analyze the input image and provide the appropriate output. To train the model, we employed a dataset from Kaggle that was already cleaned and prepared according to the CNN requirements. The dataset comprises both training and test data. We trained and tested this model accordingly. We used this trained model to provide output to the user and send alerts via email when they upload their image.
